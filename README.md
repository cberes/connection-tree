# connection-tree

A tree of connections between humans and businesses (or other types).

This is my work for one take-home programming challenge for a job interview. I replaced some files that I did not create.

## Usage

To parse a CSV file containing tree data:

    ./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/connection-tree-1.0.0.jar path/to/csv
